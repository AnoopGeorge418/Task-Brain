## **`Non Functional Requirements`** -> `How should app behave(User Experience and system expectation)` ?

1. **`Smooth Performance:`**
    - Should `have logo animation` while opening the `app` and `pages` in `0.1sec`.
    - The `app should load in under 2 seconds on most devices.`
    - `API response` times should be `under 300ms`.
    - `Tasks` should be `added`/`edited` instantly (smooth animations/local changes with later sync).
    - `AI replies` should respond `within 5â€“8 seconds max`- During the wait display `Thinking...`.

2. **`Scalability:`**
    - `Should handle:`
        - `1 user` at first
        - `100 users` in `MVP` phase
        - `10,000+ users` in `scaling` phase
    - `Modular codebase` to `support microservices later.`
    - Use `message queues for reminders/notifications` if scale grows (RabbitMQ / Redis).

3. **`Availability & Reliability:`**
    - The `app should be up 99.9% of the time.`
    - `Auto-retries` in case of network failures. 
    - Data `should not be lost even if the user reloads/refreshes` the page.

4. **`Security:`**
    - `Passwords must be hashed` and stored `securely`.
    - `Sensitive operations `(edit, delete, restore) must be `protected` by auth.
    - `Inputs` must be `validated` on `frontend` and `backend` to avoid XSS, SQLi, etc.
    - `Use HTTPS`, `secure cookies`, and `token-based auth` (JWT).
    - Use `Content Security Policy` and `CORS` headers correctly.

5. **`Responsiveness & Compatibility`**
    - The app must work on:
        - `Mobile`
        - `Desktop`
        - `Tablet`
        - `Older browsers (basic fallback)`
    - `Touch`, `keyboard`, and `mouse input supported`
    - `Light` and `dark mode` with theme memory
    
6. **`Usability & UX`**
    - `Navigation` should be `intuitive`.
    - `User should never need a manual to use basic features.`
    - `Forms` should have `clear validation errors`, f`ocus rings`, and `auto-focus`, `auto correctors`.
    - Use `consistent fonts`, `spacing`, and `button` design.

7. **`Accessibility (A11y)`**
    - `Should work` for users using:
        - `Screen readers`
        - `High contrast mode`
        - `Keyboard-only navigation`
    - Use `aria-labels`, semantic HTML, skip links, etc.

8. **`Maintainability`**
    - Codebase must follow `modular architecture`.
    - `Folder structure must follow conventions` (MVC/clean arch/etc).
    - Use `ESLint`, `Prettier`, and `code comments` where needed.
    - `Version control`: `Proper commits, branches, PRs via Git.`

9. **`Extensibility`**
    - Should allow for `new features` to be added `without breaking existing code.`
    - `Feature toggles` (for AI, workspaces, etc).
    - Support `plugin/module-based architecture in future.`

10. **`Localization & Internationalization (optional now, but good for scaling)`**
    - App should `support multiple languages` in the future.
    - Use language files (`like en.json, hi.json, etc`).

11. **`Offline Support`**
    - User `can access cached tasks without internet.`
    - `LocalStorage` or `IndexedDB` used.
    - `Sync with server once online.`

12. **`Deployment & CI/CD`**
    - App should be `deployed` on `cloud platforms` like:
    - `Netlify` (frontend)
    - `Render`/`Railway` (backend)
    - `Auto-deploy from GitHub` via CI (GitHub Actions or Railway)
    - Use `.env` for `secrets`

13. **`Testing Support`**
    - Every module should support `unit tests` (backend)
    - `UI tested` with Playwright/Cypress (later)
    - `Integration tests` for login, task creation, and reminders
